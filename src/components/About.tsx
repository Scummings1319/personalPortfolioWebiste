      <p className="aboutMe">
        At the beginning of my college career I was going to school for English
        and elementary education to pursue my interest of being an elementary
        teacher. My husband and I moved to California and in that state they
        have different schooling requirements to become a teacher so I decided
        to continue and finish my education at Arizona state university to get
        my bachelor degree in English.

        In 2021 my husband and I moved back to Michigan and that is when I
        decided to make a career change and venture into a new role. I took an
        intro to coding course at Grand Circus where we created a front-end
        webpage for a coffee shop.That is when I found out I really enjoyed
        front-end development. I enjoyed coding then instantly seeing the
        results displayed on the webpage. The design aspect is another reason I
        enjoy front-end development. After the intro to coding course, I decided
        to take the full stack javascript bootcamp, which I recently completed
        in July.
